# nebula-cli

This project is used with the [Nebula Server](https://github.com/tedivm/nebula) to grant shell script and CLI access to the [Provisioning API](https://github.com/tedivm/nebula/wiki/Provisioning-API).

On newly launched Nebula user instances this program can be in conjection with the system's provisioning system to-

* Notify Nebula when provisioning has completed,
* Change the Name of the instance without granting permission for the machine to edit other AWS Tags,
* Restrict access to the machine to a specific user.
